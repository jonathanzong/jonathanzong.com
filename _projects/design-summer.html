  <a href="http://designsummer.me/" target="_blank">Design Summer</a> is a community for students in the Bay Area interested in design founded by myself and <a href="http://eric.young.li" target="_blank">Eric Li</a>. Its goal was to help summer interns meet each other, find collaborators, and learn about opportunities to work in design. It also provided a way for people to explore interests that were not always explicitly related to the tech industry, like museum trips and design workshops.

  I produced the 2015 summer program by raising sponsorship from Khosla Ventures and building relationships with designers and design recruiters at companies including Airbnb, IDEO, Facebook, Indiegogo, and others. I also organized student-run design workshops on topics such as typography and design ethics in the KPCB SF office. After I moved to New York the next summer, the program is now organized by collaborators who participated in the original program.
