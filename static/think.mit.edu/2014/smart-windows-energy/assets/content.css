    <h2>Monitoring of Arsenic in Ground Water Sources using an Innovative IoT Sensor</h2>
    <h4>Anjali Chadha, duPont Manual High School</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>Over 50 million people in the United States and over 1.8 billion people worldwide obtain
water from well-water and other ground water sources. Under the EPAâ€™s Safe Drinking Water
Act, the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) only governs the concentration of contaminants
like arsenic allowed in public water systems. There is no MCL goal set for private water sources,
so people are exposed to arsenic levels higher than the 10 ppb level on a regular basis. Sustained
exposure to Arsenic leads to cancer, skin lesions, and blood toxicity.<br>
My engineering goal is to build an automated, solar-powered IoT-based portable sensor
for arsenic using an original design. Although technologies for arsenic detection exist, they are
expensive, time-consuming and onerous to operate by a layperson. That is why a cost-effective
sensor that digitally records the amount of arsenic in water sources over time and across
locations and stores this data in the cloud can be invaluable.<br>
My sensor prototype, programmed in Python, utilizes the colorimetric technique for
arsenic detection where the input is a mercury bromide test strip, which is read inside a black box
using LEDs and converts color values into arsenic concentrations in ppb. Because the system is
solar powered, it can be used in-situ in fields or well sites. The data is collected and stored in the
cloud for easy access as well as for ongoing comparative study of the arsenic levels. The
components used include a Particle Electron cellular transmitter, an Intel Edison, a camera, and
LEDs, among others.

    <h2>Thermoelectric Arthritis Massager and Heat Therapy Device: An Ergonomic Approach to Arthritis Relief and Treatment</h2>
    <h4>Pranav Upadhyayula and Sushil Upadhyayula, Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>Over 350 million people, with the majority lying in the older population, around the
world suffer from various types of arthritis, which causes severe joint pain, discomfort, and
stiffness. Although certain procedures can be performed to help reduce the deleterious effects of
arthritis, the joint pain is often a chronic one that sufferers of this condition face for decades.
Currently, there exist some large massage systems and some handheld heat devices that allow
users to relieve some of their pain. However, these devices have glaring shortcomings: they are
either bulky or impede the userâ€™s ability to continue normal activity, they are not cost effective,
and they rely on an external source of electricity or power. This makes them unwieldy and
impractical for the entire world. Our solution uses a small thermoelectric Seebeck generator
embedded within a bandage or wrap that solely uses the difference in body and ambient
temperature to generate electricity. From this electricity, our ergonomic device can heat the area
where the bandage is using electric heating coils and can provide a relieving massage therapy
using the power of an Electromagnetic Pulse Generator. All of these electrical and physical
elements will be made on a small scale as to not provide excessive heat or a harsh massage.
Furthermore, this small scale makes them easier to manufacture and lighter to wear. The
completed apparatus will not only help with arthritis treatment, but also will have various
implications for the medical and commercial industries.

    <h2>Customized Electrochemical Gas Sensors for Fume Hood Safety</h2>
    <h4>Jonathan Kuo and Stacy Hu, Torrey Pines High School</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>Although fume hoods have significantly improved gas ventilation when working with noxious
chemicals, improper usage or mechanical errors can compromise the safety of fume hood users.
Cluttered workspaces, airflow disturbances, and incorrect sash height can all contribute to gas
leakage during fume hood use. Airflow monitors can only detect the volume of air being
removed by the fume hood and are unable to determine the amounts of toxic gases leaking from
the fume hood. We seek to design several electrochemical gas sensors specific to commonly
used laboratory gases that can measure real-time gas concentrations in parts per million (ppm).
Depending on their specific experiments, chemists and other laboratory workers would be able to
customize a selection of reagents to monitor, alerting them of exceeded Ceiling Limits (CL), the
amount of gaseous contaminant a worker may be exposed to at any time, in accordance with
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) standards. Our gas
sensors consist of a platinum (Pt) working electrode, Pt counter electrode, a silver/silver chloride
(Ag/AgCl) reference electrode all bathed in ionic liquid 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen
sulfate (EMIM-HS); an activated charcoal filter preventing unwanted gas flow into the sensor;
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE/Teflon) membranes preventing electrolyte flow out of the sensor;
and a potentiostat that connects to the sensor and maintains a constant potential. Each gas sensor
can be placed onto Velcro strips adhered to the front of the fume hood, allowing for easy
substitution of different sensors depending on reagents workers use.

    <h2>Development and Testing of Functionalized Hypercrosslinked Polymer Resins for Adsorption of Rare Earth Elements</h2>
    <h4>Vera Zarubin, The Bronx High School of Science</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>Rare earth elements are irreplaceable components of modern technologies due to their
unique magnetic, phosphorescent, and catalytic properties. Recycling consumer materials
containing rare earths is a promising new source of these critical materials. However, the current
recycling methods are unsustainable and limited by low efficiencies. To address this problem, I
seek to develop a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly method of recycling that exhibits
high selectivity for valuable rare earth elements. I will follow an unconventional approach to
recover dissolved rare earths by adsorption onto functionalized hypercrosslinked polymer resins.
To achieve high selectivity for valuable rare earths, surface functionalities such as diglycolamide
ligands will be grafted to the resins by a solution polymerization technique and the ligand
conformations to the resins will be simulated with the molecular modeling suite Autodock Vina.
Neodymium magnets and light phosphors from end-of-life consumer products will be dissolved
separately in dilute acid, and functionalized resins will be introduced as adsorbents. The main
characteristics of the adsorption behavior will be inferred by means of isotherm, kinetics,
desorption, and thermodynamic studies. The rare earths can be desorbed from the resins with
water or edetic acid and directly reused for applications with minimal processing. This novel
approach is expected to be applicable to recycling end-of-life products, including light phosphors
and magnets, to diversify and improve the sustainability of the rare earths supply chain.

    <h2>A Novel Approach to Compression of Vector-Based Video through Motion Tracking</h2>
    <h4>Abhi Upadhyay and Kanav Kalucha, Mission San Jose High School</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>As the age of technology progresses, the demand for video with higher and higher
resolution increases accordingly, and as video compression algorithms approach near-theoretically
perfect compression, more bandwidth is necessary to transfer video streams. A higher resolution
does not change the fact that zooming eventually causes the video to become grainy and largely
unviewable. Rasterized video is the norm right now, but that entails tedious manual motion
tracking and an inability to zoom into videos without pixelating and destroying the coherence of
the video as a whole. Through our project, we hope to create a new video codec, which will use
vectors as its primitive objects, not pixels. Vectors are precomputed lines defined by mathematical
functions, and so maintain consistency no matter what the scale. They are already used for graphic
design and typesetting, and we hope to extend their functionality to improve video compression,
resolution, and scalability by utilizing the vast computational resources available today. Each
frame in our video will be constructed entirely from vectors, and we will also group vectors as
'objects' across frames to make for easier video manipulation and editing and to further compress
our video. Through this novel approach to video compression and storage, we can effectively
reduce the size of a raw vector video by around 55%, and have it in a format where video editing
is simplified and streamlined.

    <h2>Piezoelectric Plates as a Method for Vibrational Energy Harvesting in Roads</h2>
    <h4>Vishnu Pulavarthi and Chester Huynh, Maggie L. Walker Governor's School</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>Wasted power is a problem which has plagued municipalities for some time, costing great
amounts of money and wasting electricity. Traffic lights at intersections and speed sensors often
run for 24 hours at times where commuting traffic is very low. This problem of wasting
electricity is one we are trying to solve through the use of a novel implementation of a
piezoelectric system in a roadway. Piezoelectric materials become electrically polarized in
response to a mechanical stress, therefore being capable of generating an electric charge.<br>
By placing piezoelectric materials over the surface of a roadway, a piezoelectric material
can be oscillated with a driving frequency provided by the weight of passing objects such as cars.
The purpose of this investigation is create a mass producible load bearing piezoelectric ceramic
to be placed on the surface of a road to generate electricity. To achieve success, our method must
be able to support the weight of a range of large vehicles and align the driving frequency
provided by a moving mass with the resonant frequency of a piezoelectric plate.<br>
To test this idea, we will operate the project on a lower scale using a thin asphalt surface,
small scale piezoelectric panels, and proportionally small moving objects of various masses. The
results of this investigation will then be scaled up to simulate what would potentially occur in
real scenario. To implement this idea effectively, the piezoelectric panels should be placed over
roads of highly populated metropolitan areas.

    <h2>Turning Nuclear Waste into Usable Energy</h2>
    <h4>Armaun Sanayei, Basis Independent Silicon Valley</h4><br><br>

    <h4><i>Abstract: </i></h4>
    <p>The nuclear industry generates a total of about 12,000 metric tons of high-level
radioactive waste per year (USNCR). This fuel just ends up in dry and wet used fuel storage
facilities, taking up space, and waiting for a permanent solution to be found. There is an ongoing
controversy over high-level radioactive waste, and it stands as a major constraint in the global
expansion of nuclear energy; however, this used fuel may not be a dead end. As the name
suggests, this used fuel still produces large amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation.
What if one could harness this energy as one does with other forms electro-magnetic radiation?
Through using the radioluminescent properties of phosphors like Gd2O2S:Tb , one can convert
short wavelength radiation (x-ray and gamma radiation) into the visible spectrum and capture
that energy via photovoltaic cells. By placing a phosphor, like Gd2O2S:Tb, above the
photovoltaic module encapsulant, and using an amorphous-Silicon cell in order to efficiently
capture the ~510nm wavelength light emitted from the phosphor, one can capture lots of
radiation energy that would otherwise go to waste in a very simple , cost effective, and easy to
implement way. To test the energy generation module, one can use medical x-rays or any other
radiation sources to simulate the radiation emitted from nuclear waste. To further the
applicability of the invention, one can calculate the amount of energy produced, and create an
easy add-on component to a modern fuel assembly to generate energy.

    <p>Ramya is a sophomore from Burlingame, California majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Unfortunately, Ramya never got a chance to do research or participate in academic competitions in high school, and this along with the excitement working with younger students brings her is why she became a part of THINK. When she isn't pset-ing, Ramya loves learning about international relations and stalking startup founders and venture capitalists on Twitter.</p>
