  <strong>Disembody</strong> is a VR experience that allows you to see from an out-of-body point of view. A webcam streams a low-latency video feed over USB-C to an Android phone, which splits the video onto two surface views and applies a Cardboard-compatible VR lens transformation.

  The initial intent was to let someone view themself as if they were a character in a 3rd-person video game; however, through letting people play with the prototype more interesting configurations were discovered. For example, a partner could wear the camera and be your eyes, or you could point it behind you and walk backwards.

  The brain relies heavily on visual information for a sense of place, and even a sense of self. People who have used Disembody report a surreal feeling of both visual and cognitive disembodiment.
