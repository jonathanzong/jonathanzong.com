      <strong>GameCalc</strong> is a gamified calculator app. The player start with a limited number of buttons. They unlock new buttons on the calculator by doing math. For example, 1+1 unlocks 2, and also unlocks the multiplication operator (because multiplication is defined as repeated addition).
